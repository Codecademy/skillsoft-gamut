description: Use this skill when moving an app from @codecademy/gamut* packages to @skillsoft/gamut* — running or re-running the scope-swap codemod (@skillsoft/gamut-codemods), triaging its warnings and leftovers, and fixing what it can't rewrite, such as deep imports, Video, renamed Menu exports, tsconfig dom, jest mocks, ESLint plugin keys, Module Federation shared config, the removed gamut-kit, and preview builds. Not for day-to-day Gamut usage after the move (see gamut-review) or for building new UI.

# Gamut Scope Swap

Help an app move from `@codecademy/gamut*` to `@skillsoft/gamut*`. The codemod does the mechanical rewrite. This skill covers what the codemod reports, what it leaves for a person, and how to check the result.

For a short overview of every breaking change, read [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](BREAKING_CHANGES.md). Load it only when you need the full list. The sections below cover triage.

Sources of truth, in order:

1. The codemod's README in `@skillsoft/gamut-codemods`, and `npx @skillsoft/gamut-codemods list` for the migrations in each preset.
2. The installed `@skillsoft/gamut` type declarations in `node_modules`. Before you suggest an import, confirm the symbol is actually exported there. Don't invent replacements.
3. The rest of the Gamut skills in this plugin, for choosing a replacement component or style API.

## Workflow

1. **Check the starting state.** Run `git status`. The codemod refuses to write into uncommitted changes unless it gets `--force`. If the tree is dirty, ask the user to commit or stash first. Don't add `--force` on your own.
2. **Preview.** Run `npx @skillsoft/gamut-codemods scope-swap . --dry`. It prints every file it would change and its warnings, and writes nothing. Run this before a real run.
3. **Run it,** once the user confirms: `npx @skillsoft/gamut-codemods scope-swap .`. Options:
   - `--only=deep-imports,scope-rename` runs a subset of migrations.
   - `--no-report` skips the leftovers report.
   - To undo a run, `git checkout .`. That only restores the original state if the tree was clean before the run.
4. **Triage the output in this order.** Warnings first, because some change runtime behavior. Then leftovers. Then next steps.
5. **Verify.** Reinstall with `yarn`, run the formatter, then type-check, lint, test, and build. If the app uses Module Federation, test the host and its remotes together.

If the codemod has already run, ask the user to paste the warnings and the leftovers list. If they can't, find the old names yourself. Exclude lockfiles and build output:

```sh
grep -rn "@codecademy/gamut" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=dist --exclude=yarn.lock .
```

## Warnings

Each warning starts with `[migration-name] file:line`. The migration name tells you what to check. A skipped migration prints `[migration-name] skipped: <reason>` before the run. `eslint-comments` skips itself when the repo has a flat ESLint config (see Leftovers).

| Migration                  | Warning starts with                                                             | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Leftovers

The leftovers list shows every line that still names an old package. The codemod doesn't rewrite these, and the regex can produce false positives. Go through them one by one:

- **Jest `moduleNameMapper` regexes and tsconfig `paths`.** Update them to the `@skillsoft/*` names. A stale mapper makes tests fail to resolve modules.
- **Flat ESLint configs (`eslint.config.*`) and `.eslintrc.js`.** The codemod doesn't rewrite these. Only the package import changes (`import gamut from '@skillsoft/eslint-plugin-gamut'`). The rule prefix and directive prefix must match the key the plugin is registered under, or ESLint reports rules it can't find:
  - Flat config: the prefix is the `plugins` key. With `plugins: { gamut }`, rules and directives stay `gamut/<rule>`. When the repo has a flat config, `eslint-comments` leaves directives alone.
  - Legacy `.eslintrc` / `.eslintrc.json`: `eslint-config` and `eslint-comments` move everything to `plugin:@skillsoft/gamut/...` and `@skillsoft/gamut/<rule>`.
  - To rename the flat-config key, rename the key, every rule key, and every directive together.
- **Scripts and CI that read `@codecademy/gamut-kit`.** Version-sync scripts like `sync-gamut-deps` read the kit's `package.json` from `node_modules` and exit when it's missing, which fails CI. Delete them, or make them check that every `@skillsoft` Gamut package uses the same version (they're released together). Update the docs that point to them.
- **Storybook config, docs, and comments.** Update them or leave them, but know they still say the old name.
- **Code samples in `.mdx`.** Fenced code blocks are left alone on purpose. Update them by hand if they matter.
- **Files the parser skipped.** Every file is parsed as `tsx`, so Flow-typed JavaScript is skipped. Fix any old names left in those files by hand.

Don't edit `yarn.lock` by hand. Reinstalling updates it.

## Runs from an older codemod build

Migrations match the old `@codecademy` names, so running a newer build over a repo that's already been swapped does nothing for code that has already been renamed. If the first run used an older build (a pkg.pr.new preview, say), check by hand what newer builds handle:

- **Directives under a flat config.** Older builds rewrote `gamut/` directives to `@skillsoft/gamut/` even when the flat config registers the plugin as `gamut`. Change them back. Lint doesn't always flag this, because a directive that names an unknown rule just stops suppressing anything. Current builds list these in the leftovers, with a note, unless a config registers the plugin as `'@skillsoft/gamut'`.
- **Duplicate imports.** Older `deep-imports` builds added a second `import … from '@skillsoft/gamut'` next to the existing one. `eslint --fix` merges them (`import/no-duplicates`).
- **`<Markdown>` iframes and videos.** Current builds skip `markdown-video-overrides` when the repo is already on upstream 74.0.0 or newer, because those apps already pass the overrides where they want them. On an older upstream release, add them as described under `markdown-video-overrides` above.
- **`esmExternals: false` and newer-than-source versions.** Run `npx @skillsoft/gamut-codemods scope-swap . --dry` with the current build. Report-only migrations like `next-config`, `tsconfig-dom`, and `package-json` still warn.

## Next steps

After the migrations finish:

1. Reinstall with `yarn`.
2. Run the formatter and lint autofix (`prettier --write`, then `eslint --fix`). Split imports from `moved-exports` come out in recast's style, and `@skillsoft` sorts differently from `@codecademy`, so import-order rules like `simple-import-sort` fail until you do.
3. Type-check, run tests, and build.
4. If the app uses Module Federation, run the host and every remote together.
5. If the app depends on preview builds, point every `@skillsoft/*` package at the same preview (including `@skillsoft/eslint-plugin-gamut`) and pin them all with `resolutions`. The codemod README has the exact JSON. Published releases don't need it.

## What not to do

- Don't re-add `@codecademy/gamut-kit`, and don't create `@skillsoft/gamut-kit`.`@codecademy/gamut-kit` is deprecated and `@skillsoft/gamut-kit` never existed. Depend on the individual packages it bundled.
- Don't fix a warning by deep-importing a `dist` path. Find a public export, or ask the Gamut team.
- Don't silence a warning or leftover by removing the `@skillsoft` entry it points at.
- Don't bump any `@skillsoft/*` package outside the group's shared version. The packages move together.
- Don't run the codemod on a dirty tree, and don't pass `--force` to get past the check.

## Reporting back

Say what the codemod changed, which warnings and leftovers are still open, which ones you fixed, and what the user should verify by hand. If you haven't seen the codemod output, ask for it before you start guessing at fixes.
